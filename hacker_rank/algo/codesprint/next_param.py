"""
Generate the lexicographically next permutation of a sequence
of elements.

Pseudo-code:

1. Find the largest index k such that a[k] < a[k + 1].
   If no such index exists, the permutation is the last permutation.
2. Find the largest index l such that a[k] < a[l].
   Since k + 1 is such an index, l is well defined and satisfies k < l.
3. Swap a[k] with a[l].
4. Reverse the sequence from a[k + 1] up to and including the final element a[n].
